It now comes automatically bundled with an extension for inserting citations into Microsoft Word and Libre Writer.\nOnce installed, you should be able to open Zotero and see this:\nYou should also consider creating an online account so your local library can sync with the cloud service. This is free. You can link the Zotero app to your account under \u0026ldquo;Zotero\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Preferences\u0026rdquo;:\nThe Zotero tab should be present on Microsoft Word. This works on Windows and Mac versions, and it also works with Libre Office.\nThere is also a large number of plugins to consider.\nAdding references Formats Many journals provide options for direct import of a reference into. NCBI, Springer, ASA-CSSA-SSSA and many more are quite good at this.\nOften many formats are offered, each specifc to a particular software. If you see an option for Zotero, clearly that will work fine for importation. Otherwise, a plain .RIS file is the best option. I often choose \u0026ldquo;RefWorks\u0026rdquo; as the format for that program is compatible with Zotero.\nImporting References  Example: Springer. Mapping of a major gene for the slow ripening character in peach: co-location with the maturity date gene and development of a candidate gene-based diagnostic marker for its selection  Example: NCBI. QTL analysis of quality traits in an advanced backcross between Prunus persica cultivars and the wild relative species P. davidiana  Example: PMC Full text. The impact of genetic relationship information on genome-assisted breeding values  Example: ASHS. Variability in sugars, acids, firmness, and color characteristics of 12 peach genotypes  Example: Multiple References. Fixed-length haplotypes can improve genomic prediction accuracy in an admixed dairy cattle population   Manual Addition A references can always be entered by hand under \u0026ldquo;File\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;New Item\u0026rdquo;. This is laborious and likely to result in errors, so I do not recommend it. However, sometimes there is no choice.\nPDFs and other attachments are usually added manually. Use the paperclip icon to attached local files. An exception is importing an existing library.\nOther Reference Types Zotero offers many reference types. The default item type used by Zotero (and scientists) is \u0026ldquo;Journal Article\u0026rdquo;. However, there are a number of other types to consider. Here is a sampling of other commonly-used item types:\n Book or Book Section   Dissertation   Conference Paper   Webpage  Using these different types enables users to capture the information essential to the particular reference. For citation purposes, journals have developed a set of formatting guidelines for each reference type. By using the correct reference type, references are more likely to be properly formatted within documents.\nEditing References Regardless of how references are added, all references should be inspected once to ensure all elements are as expected. Sometimes, article titles or author names are in all caps. Often, each word in an article title is capitalized. Occasionally, the abstract and title are merged, making for an epically long title. For books, editors may not be included or may be improperly labelled. The citation manager will not be able to correct these issues - it is up to users to do this.\nThe most notable drawback to Zotero is that you will lose italics. This can be ignored in abstracts, but if you plan on citing an article with an italicized word in the title, it is best to fix this. To do so, flank the italized text in the following html code:\n\u0026lt;i\u0026gt; your italicized text \u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;  Which will look like this after inserted into a list of references:  your italized text \nJournal names are not always standardized. This can sometimes be ignored since the Medline abbreviations are used. For example, here are several variations in name of a reputable journal commonly called \u0026ldquo;PNAS\u0026rdquo;:\n PNAS PNAS USA Proc Natl Acad Sci Proc Natl Acad Sci USA Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  Manipulating Zotero For dedicated users, a reference library can become quite large and unwieldy. Hence knowelge on how to organize, filter and search a library are essential to taking full advantage of the information stored in personal or shared reference library.\nOrganize References into Collections References can be organized into many collections. Collections or subcollections can be created by right clicking within the left menu and choosing the appropriate option. References are added to collections by highlighting and dropping and dragging them to the appropriate collection. References can belong to multiple collections. Collections are not hierarchical: membership in a subcollection does not guarantee membership in the higher collection.\nGroup collections are a shared resource. These are created on the Zotero website and other zotero users can be invited to join. These can be private or public.\nFinding References You can sort references by several of the fields in the references: date, title author, date added, attachments. References can be searched with the search bar by \u0026ldquo;everything\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;all fields and tags\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Title, creator, date\u0026rdquo;. Tags are the equivalent of \u0026ldquo;keywords\u0026rdquo; used in classifying journal articles. Searches can also be restricted to within collections.\n![zotero_filter](/zotero_filter.png) Citations Automated citation management is perhaps the most useful aspects of a reference software. With Zotero, it\u0026rsquo;s also very easy to use.\nFirst, you need to install the desired citation style. Major journals have made their styles available on the Zotero Style Repository . To download one, you can directly download it from the Zotero style repository webpage and import into Zotero. Alternatively, Zotero provides an option directly in their user interface through \u0026ldquo;Zotero\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Preferences\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Cite\u0026rdquo;:\n![zotero_styles](zotero_styles.png) Inserting and Editing References\nOpen a word document and try to insert a reference where your cursor is located in the document with \u0026ldquo;Add/Edit Citation\u0026rdquo;. It will prompt you to choose a style the first time you do this.\nTo change the content in a single group of references, place your cursor in the reference and click \u0026ldquo;Add/Edit Citation\u0026rdquo;. You can delete and/or add references.\nReferences can be moved around as whole text or deleted entirely like any normal document text. Zotero will automatically detect their removal and update the bibliography.\nUsers may want to cite papers as such: \u0026ldquo;Coombe (1976) found that\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;. In this example, the default format \u0026ldquo;Coombe (Coombe 1976) found that\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; is incorrect. To remove the author name from the citation, choose \u0026ldquo;classic view\u0026rdquo; from the dropdown menu:\nand click \u0026ldquo;suppress author\u0026rdquo;:\nAdding a Bibliography\nTo add a list of ordered cited works to a document, place your cursor where you would like the reference list inserted and click \u0026ldquo;Add/Edit Bibliography\u0026rdquo;. This can be added and deleted repeatedly if needed.\nThe button \u0026ldquo;Document Preferences\u0026rdquo; can be used to change the citation style across the entire document if needed.\nNote that the bibliography formatting will default to the text type defined for the block (usually \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo;). If you want it to look different (smaller, different font, etc), you will have to redefine that block or the elements of that type.\nUnlink Citations\nThis will remove all links between references, so be careful using this button, as you will have to manually edit references from this point forward. It is probably best to copy your document first.\nTroubleshooting For some reason, normal journals are being formatted as webpages. This can happen if the URL field is filled out. Delete or move that content for the references in question.\nI accidentially added the wrong PDF to the article. Duplicate the reference within Zotero, delete the old reference and add the correct attachment.\nOh snap - my whole library was wiped. What should I do? You should back it up from this point forward. Here are some instructions . There are some file recovery tools for individual systems. There is also a Zotero plugin for pulling references out of your papers.\nI accidentially imported all references from a single article rather than only the citation for that article. Sort the references from the date added and remove all those added at that particular time stamp.\nI think there are tons of duplicates in my library - how can I fix this? Zotero has a feature for removing duplicates. Look on the left menu for \u0026ldquo;Duplicate Items\u0026rdquo; to clean those up.\nHelp! I\u0026rsquo;m having some mystery issue that no one has ever experienced. Zotero has a huge userbase who take advantage of the forums for troubleshooting. If you cannot find your solution there, then post your problem, and the community is likely to help you.\n","date":1521395402,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521395402,"objectID":"985edd2192bbac1e47b797fd17d85065","permalink":"/tutorials/zotero/zotero_workshop/","publishdate":"2018-03-18T10:50:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/tutorials/zotero/zotero_workshop/","section":"tutorials","summary":"Installation Step 1: install Zotero .

While cherry breeding has been conducted in the Pacific Northwest for over half a century, little is known about the genetic architecture of important traits. We used a genome-enabled mixed model to predict the genetic performance of 505 individuals for 32 phenological, disease response and fruit quality traits evaluated in the RosBREED sweet cherry crop data set. Genome-wide predictions were estimated using a repeated measures model for phenotypic data across 3 years, incorporating additive, dominance and epistatic variance components. Genomic relationship matrices were constructed with high-density SNP data and were used to estimate relatedness and account for incomplete replication across years. High broad-sense heritabilities of 0.83, 0.77, and 0.76 were observed for days to maturity, firmness, and fruit weight, respectively. Epistatic variance exceeded 40\\% of the total genetic variance for maturing timing, firmness and powdery mildew response. Dominance variance was the largest for fruit weight and fruit size at 34\\% and 27\\%, respectively. Omission of non-additive sources of genetic variance from the genetic model resulted in inflation of narrow-sense heritability but minimally influenced prediction accuracy of genetic values in validation. Predicted genetic rankings of individuals from single-year models were inconsistent across years, likely due to incomplete sampling of the population genetic variance. Predicted breeding values and genetic values revealed many high-performing individuals for use as parents and the most promising selections to advance for cultivar release consideration, respectively. This study highlights the importance of using the appropriate genetic model for calculating breeding values to avoid inflation of expected parental contribution to genetic gain. The genomic predictions obtained will enable breeders to efficiently leverage the genetic potential of North American sweet cherry germplasm by identifying high quality individuals more rapidly than with phenotypic data alone.","tags":["genetics","plant breeding","sweet cherry"],"title":"Genomic heritability estimates in sweet cherry reveal non-additive genetic variance is relevant for industry-prioritized traits.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski","Brown, David","Campbell, Kimberly Garland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579651200,"objectID":"9d4527f4ab39cde67d166a7917af32b1","permalink":"/publication/nir_calib/","publishdate":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nir_calib/","section":"publication","summary":"Soluble stem carbohydrates are a component of drought response in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other grasses. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) can rapidly assay for soluble carbohydrates indirectly, but this requires a statistical model for calibration. The objectives of this study were: (i) to build a robust calibration between the NIR spectra and soluble carbohydrate concentration of ground wheat stems; and (ii) to determine whether soluble stem carbohydrates are correlated with yield rankings of drought-stricken wheat grown in the northwestern United States. Five spring wheat cultivars were grown in field trials conducted at six environments in the state of Washington varying in annual precipitation from 212 to 474 mm. Wheat stems were harvested from all plots at the onset of grain fill and assayed for NIR reflectance. Soluble stem carbohydrates were determined on a subset of the samples. The NIR data were calibrated to soluble stem carbohydrates using multiple linear regression, partial least squares regression, ridge regression with best linear unbiased prediction, random forest, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), elastic net, and Bayesian lasso regression. Partial least squares regression provided the most accurate and reliable predictions for soluble carbohydrates. Correlations between soluble stem carbohydrates and grain yield were consistent across environments (r = 0.904 and ρ = 0.80). The effect of environment on the variation in response variables was lower for soluble carbohydrates than yield (5.93 and 71.7%, respectively) across environments. These data provide evidence that stem carbohydrates can aid in selecting cultivars with enhanced drought resilience.","tags":["drought tolerance","plant breeding","wheat"],"title":"Near-infrared calibration of soluble stem carbohydrates for predicting drought tolerance in spring wheat","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hardner, Craig M.","Hayes, Ben J.","Kumar, Satish","Vanderzande, Stijn","Cai, Lichun","Julia Piaskowski","Quero-Garcia, José","Campoy, José Antonio","Barreneche, Teresa","Giovannini, Daniela","Liverani, Alessandro","Charlot, Gérard","Villamil-Castro, Miguel","Oraguzie, Nnadozie","Peace, Cameron P."],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Phenotypic variation for phenology of fruit maturity in sweet cherry appears to be under strong genetic control, but that control might be complicated by phenotypic instability across environments. Although such genotype-by-environment interaction (G × E) is a common phenomenon in crop plants, knowledge about it is lacking for fruit maturity timing and other sweet cherry traits. In this study, 1673 genome-wide SNP markers were used to estimate genomic relationships among 597 weakly pedigree-connected individuals evaluated over two seasons at three locations in Europe and one location in the USA, thus sampling eight ‘environments’. The combined dataset enabled a single meta-analysis to investigate the environmental stability of genomic predictions. Linkage disequilibrium among marker loci declined rapidly with physical distance, and ordination of the relationship matrix suggested no strong structure among germplasm. The most parsimonious G × E model allowed heterogeneous genetic variance and pairwise covariances among environments. Narrow-sense genomic heritability was very high (0.60–0.83), as was accuracy of predicted breeding values ({\\textgreater}0.62). Average correlation of additive effects among environments was high (0.96) and breeding values were highly correlated across locations. Results indicated that genomic models can be used in cherry to accurately predict date of fruit maturity for untested individuals in new environments. Limited G × E for this trait indicated that phenotypes of individuals will be stable across similar environments. Equivalent analyses for other sweet cherry traits, for which multiple years of data are commonly available among breeders and cultivar testers, would be informative for predicting performance of elite selections and cultivars in new environments.","tags":["plant breeding","genetics","sweet cherry"],"title":"Prediction of Genetic Value for Sweet Cherry Fruit Maturity among Environments Using a 6K SNP Array.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mugabe, Deus","Coyne, Clarice J.","Julia Piaskowski","Zheng, Ping","Ma, Yu","Landry, Erik","McGee, Rebecca","Main, Doreen","Vandemark, George","Zhang, Hongbin","Abbo, Shahal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579651200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579651200,"objectID":"f680ccb00e960e9e03287b8d2b3a67ab","permalink":"/publication/chickpea_qtl_cold/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chickpea_qtl_cold/","section":"publication","summary":"Fall-sown chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) yields are often double those of spring-sown chickpea in regions with Mediterranean climates that have mild winters. However, winter kill can limit the productivity of fall-sown chickpea. Developing cold-tolerant chickpea would allow the expansion of the current geographic range where chickpea is grown and also improve productivity. The objective of this study was to identify the quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with cold tolerance in chickpea. An interspecific recombinant inbred line population of 129 lines derived from a cross between ICC 4958, a cold-sensitive desi type (C. arietinum), and PI 489777, a cold-tolerant wild relative (C. reticulatum Ladiz), was used in this study. The population was phenotyped for cold tolerance in the field over four field seasons (September 2011–March 2015) and under controlled conditions two times. The population was genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing, and an interspecific genetic linkage map consisting of 747 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, spanning a distance of 393.7 cM, was developed. Three significant QTL were found on linkage groups (LGs) 1B, 3, and 8. The QTL on LGs 3 and 8 were consistently detected in six environments with logarithm of odds score ranges of 5.16 to 15.11 and 5.68 to 23.96, respectively. The QTL CT Ca-3.1 explained 7.15 to 34.6\\% of the phenotypic variance in all environments, whereas QTL CT Ca-8.1 explained 11.5 to 48.4\\%.

Try to eliminate it (you may not succeed but that’s ok). Repeat until your code is “fast enough.”   Easy peasy, right???\nSome general guidelines for speeding up R code  Use data frames less - they are expensive to create, often copied in whole when modified, and their rownames attribute can really slow things down. Be wary of using functions that copy objects in whole: c(), append(), cbind(), rbind(), or paste(). When used in loops, you can get a massive proliferation of objects in memory. Use vectorised functions:  apply, lapply, sapply, vapply, tapply, mapply rowSums, colSums, rowMeans, colMeans, cumsum, diff   Base functions are designed to handle wildly different input. Consider rewriting base functions for highly repetitive tasks. Use parallel::mclapply for parallelising functions. Consider an optimized matrix algebra library (beyond BLAS) for better performance (e.g. Apple vecLib BLAS , openBLAS ). If you work with sparse matrices, use tools for them like the package \u0026lsquo;Matrix\u0026rsquo;. For huge objects, consider storing the information in a database and accessing it with \u0026lsquo;dbplyr\u0026rsquo;. The packages \u0026lsquo;dbglm\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;tidypredict\u0026rsquo; will also do model fitting with data inside a database. Another solution for large objects are specialized formats like HDF5 or netCDF . Take advantage of the Rcpp suite of programs - not just for C/C++ programmers (e.g. RcppArmadillo::fastlm).

The first 50 rows were summary stats (\u0026hellip;I think), and then the actual data started. The file was over 250 columns wide, composed largely of phenotypic traits. Perhaps one third of the columns were unique variables gathered over several years, but, the variable names were inconsistent across years. Actually, there was no information on the variables, what they were measuring, and what scale they were on. The closest hint was a pattern of color coding applied to groups of columns: yellow, green, blue. There appeared to be partial duplication and/or combination of of some columns, but we could not reconstruct exactly what had happened to the data. No one could recall the full history of the file, what that color coding meant, who had pre-processed data, or what they had done. We did know that the raw data were long lost.\nThis was the not the first nor the last messy data set with an unknown history that complicated my capacity to organize and analyse the information.\nOther problems I encountered with poorly managed data sets:\n Date sets with outliers removed based on individual\u0026rsquo;s researchers assessment on what looked weird or not. An Excel file several thousand lines with miscellaneous comments added every so often indicating a data point may be suspect. An Excel file several sheets wide of the same information across different years - yet the column names did not match, and some sheets included summary stats for groups of data, using empty rows to differentiate groups (again, I think this was what going on\u0026hellip;).  There\u0026rsquo;s no way to sugarcoat it: management of raw experimental data and the analysis workflow is largely abysmal in the agricultural sciences, my academic home for 14 years. The process of cleaning, rearranging, filtering and preparing experimental data for downstream analyses is poorly described, if at all, in most papers. As many of know, much of data conditioning and preparation is done by students and technicians with little formal guidance or documentation of their work.\nSince data sets can and should live on for decades - as part of long-term agriculture research, for meta-analyses or other uses, understanding how the raw data were parsed, cleaned and interpreted is important. Assumptions that made sense in the initial analysis may need re-evaluation later. Intermediate files can turn out to be useful. Organization of an analysis workflow can help researchers conduct their research in a regimented and reproducible way.\nHere are a few concrete recommendations for improving workflow:\n Archive the raw, unaltered version of data set. Create a consistent directory structure for each project - that way you are storing things consistently and can find them. Really, this makes things easier for everyone. For a data set, each column should be include only type of data corresponding to the column name. These data can be on different scales. For example, if one column indicates the type of variable (e.g. pH, moisture content, nitrate concentration), another columns could indicate the actual value for that trait and observation. It is less confusing if a column only contain a similar type of data (e.g raw OR transformed OR mean value), not data and summary stats together. Avoid use of formatting that cannot be interpreted as plain text. By this, I mean do not insert comments in Microsoft office files, or use text formatting tools (bolding, color coding) to differentiate observations. This information can easily become lost to time and does not translate well to other software, especially command-line software. Comments, categorical variables, et cetera should each have their own column. Summary stats of a data set belong in their own table or file. Use a non-proprietary format like CSV or TXT. Avoid creating data that relies on a particular order of the observations (for instance, every 5th row is the mean of the previous 4 rows). One sorting step can ruin this. If a special order is needed, create a column which implements this. Make a \u0026ldquo;codebook\u0026rdquo; documenting what each variable means, what scale it is on, expected levels or range of data. This can be one sheet of information - very brief, but handy. Giving variables short, descriptive names is also helpful. Document what happens to a data set - and make that information available to others. I prefer to use a command line tool like R, but a text file could do. This is to ensure your work can be duplicated. I realize programming is not for everyone, but using a command-line program like R, Python, Julia, SAS, or even bash, is one of the best ways to document how information is pre-processed. Changes made through point-and-click interfaces like Excel are not reproducible because they are almost always incompletely documented or not documented at all. In addition, manual manipulation in a spreadsheet program also results in user-generated errors: misspellings, misclassifications, cut-and-paste errors and so on. Accountability and follow up: attach people\u0026rsquo;s names to their data and/or analysis. Back up your data: across at least 2 locations over the life of your project. Version control make it possible for your work to be undone by accessing earlier versions. Git is one such tool, but saving intermediate file versions (often!) can also help. By providing descriptive comments at each new commit (a version), that can help downstream researchers sift through previous versions of the data. Also, some cloud storage providers (like Dropbox) offer options for data recovery. Coordinate with project collaborators regarding workflow expectations and processes  The core reason I am interested in these issues is to improve reproducibility. As I dealt with the aforementioned issues with data, I could not help but wonder if I was making the right choices with the data, and wish that I had more information on the background of these legacy data sets. This is particularly important as meta-studies continue to gain in popularity. Unifying data sets and leveraging their combined power is one of the priorities for agricultural productivity identified by the National Academy of Sciences in their recent report, Science Breakthroughs to Advance Food and Agricultural Research by 2030 .\nFor more information, see this excellent article by Kara Woo and Karl Broman - it\u0026rsquo;s short and gives easy-to-follow best practices when working with spreadsheets.\nScott Long at the University of Indiana put together an informative set of slides delving further into the principles of data workflow. Patrick Schloss, of the bioinformatics program mothur, recently published an article delving into the problem of reproducibility in microbiome work and how to fix it. Among many things, he recommended implementing robust workflow practices.\n","date":1533664202,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533664202,"objectID":"1a6a94a95e3751dd2382bc96b2d61e12","permalink":"/post/workflow_basics/","publishdate":"2018-08-07T10:50:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/workflow_basics/","section":"post","summary":"I was struggling with the data set.

Most genetic knowledge on key traits for plant breeding has been obtained through QTL analyses. Despite an explosion in QTL discoveries for horticultural crops, very few of those discoveries have been translated into tools for horticultural crop breeding. An example of such tools with direct application in crop genetic improvement are trait-predictive DNA tests. The translation of a promising QTL to a trait-predictive DNA test has five steps: (1) choose target QTL; (2) design assay to target locus; (3) assay individuals; (4) trace inheritance; and (5) disseminate DNA test details. Key information to convey to end users about a DNA test are the crop and trait(s) addressed, targeted trait locus or loci, and marker type used; trait heritability and genotypic variance explained by the DNA test; allele effects, frequencies, and germplasm distributions; and technical details for running the test. This paper provides instructions for translating promising QTLs into breeder-friendly, trait-predictive DNA tests, based on our experience with tree fruit. Our intent is to accelerate development of trait-predictive DNA tests and establish a standard framework for reporting them. As scientific understanding of genetic factors controlling breeding-relevant traits continues to expand, systematic and increased DNA test development should help bridge the chasm between academic research and breeding application.","tags":["genetics","plant breeding"],"title":"Crossing the finish line: how to develop diagnostic DNA tests as breeding tools after QTL discovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski"],"categories":["workflow"],"content":"Basic Info I came back from PAG (Plant \u0026amp; Animal Genome - a huge ag genetics conference held in San Diego each January) all fired about setting up a virtual machine (VM) to facilitate collaboration. The hope what this would enable us to share files and scripts better (without the aid of countless dropboxes everyone forgets about), and improve overall collaboration.\nI had considered this before - enterprise deployment of RStudio server or Jupyter hub, but our program doesn’t have dedicated IT support to do this, and frankly, it all seemed rather intimidating to a plant geneticist like me. But this would be useful. I had once run my laptop on dual boot with Ubuntu and Windows. I could handle this, couldn’t I? All I want is a VM that everyone can access via remote desktop for their analytical needs. Fortunately, I had no idea how difficult this would be, or I might not have entered the lion’s den. So, here are fruits of my labor in the hopes it will ease the process for future users. This guide was developed specific for Washington State University\u0026rsquo;s College of Agriculture, Human and Natural Resource Sciences (CAHNRS).\nStep 1: Request a virtual machine. I used the CAHNRS webform . I went with CentOS 7 - a Linux distribution that had been recommended to me as “full featured” (this remains to be seen). This step may take a few weeks.\nIt helps to know exactly what you want to do so CAHNRS IT can properly set up the VM and “rules” (exceptions to their standing rules) to allow you to do the work you want. Running RStudio server means having at least one port open. The RStudio Server default port is 8787 (although than can be easily changed). Remote desktop needs port 3350 open. Jupyter Hub will have its own conventions - all described in their documentation. I recommend you consult the documentation for what you want before ordering a VM.\nStep 2: Download the WSU VPN client . Whoever is the admin will need have the WSU SSLVPN to tunnel in through a secure connection in order to do any work remotely. This is the probably the easiest step of the entire process. Who doesn’t love point-and-click installations?\nStep 3: Download software for SSH. Initially, you will need an SSH program to connect through secure, encrypted tunnel. Putty is a popular option. I like secure shell, which I found here . This is actually a rather convenient way to manage the VM, so its utility will likely stretch past the setup phase.\nGeneral Linux notes: This is CentOS, an alternative distribution to its more popular relative, Ubuntu. While most commands are the same across Linux distributions, some things are a little different. FYI, Centos is similar to .rhel and Red Hat if you are combing forums for help.\nCheck out these standards for Linux filesystems . It will help you understand how the machine is organized. Don’t spend too much time here; it’s more of a reference than pleasure reading.\n The Centos documentation can be helpful, as well.\nMiscellaneous useful commands: Most of the command listed here for VM setup require root privileges, which can be accomplished with “sudo”. You’ll find you need to be root 98% of time during VM setup, so do this:\nsudo su\nThis changes the console from: $  to: # \nUse Ctrl-D to leave root. And be careful when you are root!\nPrint current working directory:\npwd\nChange the working directory to go up a level:\ncd .. \nAbsolute path (will work everywhere):\n$ cd /\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;\nRelative path (only sees child directories):\ncd \u0026lt;path\u0026gt;\nThis produces a long list of all files and directories in your current working directory:\nll -a\nTo see options associated with a particular command:\n\u0026lt;command\u0026gt; --help\nTo remove a single file:\nrm \u0026lt;your_file.txt\u0026gt;\nTo remove an entire directory:\n‘r’ does it recursively\n‘f’ will do it without asking again (it skips the step that is essentially asking “are you sure you want to delete this????”)\nrm -rf \u0026lt;your_directory\u0026gt;\nTo install a piece of software for all users:\nsudo yum install \u0026lt;library\u0026gt;\nTo view files:\nmore \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;\nTo edit files. This command requires sudo for most of the files you will need to look at for VM setup.\nnano \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;\nThere’s also the vim editor, but use it your own risk. Here is the best description I have ever read of it:\n “If you want an outstanding free text editor and don\u0026rsquo;t mind a seemingly vertical learning curve plus long days of pain and suffering while all your neural pathways are rewired, try Vim.”\n vi \u0026lt;file\u0026gt; \nTo escape vim:\n :q \nMake a new directory:\nmkdir \u0026lt;dir_name\u0026gt;\nSetting your VM to the correct timezone (Pacific in this case). It is helpful to have the correct time when you are inspecting the logs during troubleshooting:\ntimedatectl set-timezone 'America/Los_Angeles'  Managing Users It is important to think thru how to organize the users into groups and create folders with shared permissions in order to enable collaboration.\nBelow are some common commands. Note that they all require root or sudo access. Centos provides excellent documentation on this.\nAdd a new user (the second option adds a new user to an existing group):\nuseradd \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\nuseradd \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; -g \u0026lt;groupname\u0026gt;\nSet user password:\npasswd \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\nAdd a group:\ngroupadd \u0026lt;groupname\u0026gt;\nAdd an existing user to an existing group:\nsudo usermod -a -G \u0026lt;groupname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\nEnable file ownership by a group:\nchown :\u0026lt;groupname\u0026gt; \u0026lt;path/to/directory\u0026gt;\nEnable file ownership by a user:\nchown :\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; \u0026lt;path/to/directory\u0026gt;\nDelete a user:\nuserdel \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;\nLink directories:\nln -s \u0026lt;path/to/file\u0026gt; \u0026lt;path/to/link\u0026gt;\nIf you want to run remote desktop: There are other desktop environments, but Gnome is a popular one, so why not?\nSee what is available:\nyum group list  Install Gnome desktop environment:\nsudo yum install gnome sudo yum install gnome desktop environment  Check that it is running\nps -aux | grep gnome  Install and configure the EPEL repository:\nsudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm  Add the nux repository:\nsudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm  Install xrdp:\nsudo yum -y install xrdp tigervnc*  You’ll need to start xrdp and xrdp-sesman (“session manager”) as a service (so they are always running) and enable them both to autostart:\nsudo systemctl start xrdp sudo systemctl enable xrdp sudo systemctl start xrdp-sesman sudo systemctl enable xrdp-sesman  And check:\nsudo systemctl status xrdp sudo systemctl status xrdp-sesman  These should indicate that xrdp and xrdp-sesman are active.\nOpen a port to allow remote desktop connections:\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=3389/tcp sudo firewall-cmd --reload  Configure SELinux:\nsudo chcon --type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp sudo chcon --type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman  And check that the port is open:\nnetstat -plan | grep xrdp  Next, vnc has to be started. It is tied to a user, so get out of root if you are there (and don’t use sudo).\nSet a password:\nvncpasswd -\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;  It will return a prompt, asking you for a password. This is what you will use for remote desktop. You can definitely skip the step of having a read-only password by answering “n” for no. (It’s unclear to me why anyone would want a password for that as opposed to whole new user account with read-only permissions, but what do I know?).\nNext, start the server. Try to only do this once.\nvnc server  If you end up with multiple vnc server instances running on just ONE user account, kill the extra processes and delete their log files. Here are the steps:\nFirst, find the process ID’s:\nps aux | grep vnc  The process ID\u0026rsquo;s (pid) are located in the second column from the left. Kill the extra vnc pid\u0026rsquo;s:\nkill -9 \u0026lt;pid\u0026gt;  Find the associated files and delete them. I found there here:\ncd /var/log  They will have names like \u0026ldquo;Xorg.9.log\u0026rdquo;.\nTroubleshooting Remote Desktop If you run into trouble, try disabling SELinux:\nsudo setenforce 0  Check:\ngetenforce  (it should say “permissive” NOT “enforcing)\nCheck for problems (as root):\ncd /var/logs more xrdp.log more xrdp-sesman.log  These are cleared rapidly and folded into the xrdp .tar files, so do not be alarmed if the log files are empty. If you really want to see something in the xrdp logs, stop and restart xrdp.\nThe most useful file is the messages file, but it’s very long, so just show the end:\nsudo tail -55 messages  If you really want to see what\u0026rsquo;s going on, watch the file in real time:\ntail -f messages\nCtlr-C to leave\nThe firewalld file in the /var/log/ directory is stuffed with known, but currently unresolved bugs so it’s not very useful for diagnosing problems at this time.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a number of remote desktop applications which can be used to access the VM. Windows RDP is easy to use and secure.\nRun R in remote desktop Start by installing R. WSU would not let me access the internet directly from the remote desktop internet browser, but I could through the SSH. So here are command line instructions:\nsudo yum install epel-release sudo yum update sudo yum install R -y  Next, install RStudio. Get current link from the RStudio website .

Building an Rcpp package avoids this and is easy to do:  Rcpp.package.skeleton(\u0026quot;mypackage\u0026quot;)   The other useful workshop I participated in was methods for speeding up R, delivered by Thomas Lumley, formerly of UW and now of U of Auckland. He focused on a few major recommendations:    Vectorise whenever possible. This also implies that you know your vectorised functions:\n lapply/apply/sapply/vapply/tapply rowMeans, rowSums colMeans, colSums Consider parallelised functions: mclapply    Base functions are often designed to handle wildly different input. It may make sense in some instances to rewrite functions, making assumptions (e.g. about the input data) that fit your circumstances.\n  Data frames should be avoided if possible - they are expensive to create and often copied in whole when modified.\n  Using an optimized matrix algebra library (not LAPACK) may be worth the time to install that. These libraries have optimized how data is accessed from disk.\n  Some rec\u0026rsquo;s on how to handle large objects that reasonably don\u0026rsquo;t fit in memory:\n buy a computer with more memory (not always a reasonable option) put your data in database and access with tools like dbplyr. One recommendation is MonetDBLite, a column-optimized database good for scientific applications for that reason. Use special file formats for bigger data sets: HDF5, GitLFS    But, first and foremost, he emphasized the use of profiling tools and benchmarking functions. find out where the bottleneck in your program actually are! And be careful to not waste too much time on optimizing code - time saved may not be worth time invested. R is automatically running a JIT (just in time) compiler that makes code run faster each time it is called. It makes sense to turn this off while doing benchmarking:\n  enableJIT(0) # to turn back on: enableJIT(1)  Course notes available on his github repo UseRfasteR .\n  Excellent keynotes all-around. Steph da Silva emphasized the importance of community in open-source community - what that can look like, how to contribute how your contribution helps develop camaraderie to support sharing of code and development of analysts.\n   Roger Peng discussed development of R as it strives to fit both programmers and regular ole scientists analyzing their data. He summarized his own talk quite well in this essay. He described the rise of \u0026ldquo;worse is better\u0026rdquo;, that is, the simplying of options in R to make it easier for new users to learn. The tidyverse is considered such an example. However, as a long-time user, I find dplyr\u0026rsquo;s group-and-summarise options (among others) to be incredibly handy. And I will never go back to using reshape() now that we have gather() and spread(). Even reshape2() is a massive improvement in usability!\n  Jenny Bryan\u0026rsquo;s talk on \u0026ldquo;Code Smells and Feels\u0026rdquo; provided a great introduction to how to identify and fix poorly written code. According to Wikipedia , \u0026ldquo;Code smells are usually not bugs; they are not technically incorrect and do not prevent the program from functioning. Instead, they indicate weaknesses in design that may slow down development or increase the risk of bugs or failures in the future.\u0026rdquo; Based on the book, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, she gave a few simple directives to create simple code that is easy to understand, debug, and maintain. Hooray!\n   Hoist entry or exit conditionals to the top of functions Use functions as much as possible Avoid overly nested code (e.g. a long cascade of nested \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statements) Not every \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; needs an else Consider implementing true object-oriented programming when working with classes Don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026rsquo; be afraid to write short helper functions There was also a brief discussion on how to tell a person their code smells bad (\u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s what we have funny names like \u0026lsquo;excessive use of literals\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot;).    Excellent set of talks on data handling and workflow. In particular, a talk on the website builder for documenting data analysis called \u0026ldquo;workflowr\u0026rdquo; . Discussion on consistent workflows , recommended conventions for naming variables, creating consistent set of directories for each project, using version controls. Obvious to a data scientist, but rarely used by regular scientist. This resonates strongly with me due to ongoing issues with data management in the agricultural sciences.\n   Excellent talk on precision in R . Use .Machine to find out more, but basically R is only good to 16 decimal points. Subtraction of one number similar to it can result in cancellation where the result essentially slides to zero, losing precision. Ways to avoid this include working in log space, perhaps adding a zero if needed: log(x + 1), -log(1 - exp(x)). Also, there is the Rmpfr package .\n   Glue package - for \u0026ldquo;gluing\u0026rdquo; strings to data, like string interpolation in bash (\u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo;) or python f\u0026rdquo;{\u0026hellip;}\u0026quot;. R does have sprintf() with with identical functionality to C\u0026rsquo;s printf(), but glue makes this easier.\n   Fun talk on vwline package for creating variable-width lines, like in Menaurd\u0026rsquo;s famous plot of Napolean\u0026rsquo;s march through Russia.\n  ","date":1521395402,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521395402,"objectID":"c744f17e3dcf6d76118ca23ff5bb97f3","permalink":"/post/user_2018/","publishdate":"2018-03-18T10:50:02-07:00","relpermalink":"/post/user_2018/","section":"post","summary":"Top Lessons from R users conference held July 10 - 13 in Brisbane, AUS With 900 registrants and dozens of talks, there is much to report ( videos of most talks provided by R Consortium YouTube channel) I\u0026rsquo;ll skip loads of it and just focus on the top 10 cool stuff.\n  The hex wall was just straight up cool.

The Washington State University perennial wheat breeding program has created several hundred interspecific progeny by crossing several different cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with Thinopyrum species and × Agrotriticum spp. Prior to the chromosome composition of these wheat-wheatgrass derivatives was not characterized, limiting their utility as stable breeding germplasm. We determined the mitotic chromosome number and species origin of chromosomes for eight breeding lines, and estimated their relatedness and population structure using AFLPs. Additionally, self-pollination and outcrossing rates were estimated for these breeding lines to gain an understanding of perennial wheat’s reproductive strategy. We intercrossed the lines with each other to produce 20 families and then measured the level of chromosome pairing during meiosis I in the F1 progeny. The lines contained between 44 and 64 chromosomes, of which eight to 16 were from Th. ponticum. Our analysis of molecular diversity indicated greater genetic diversity within, rather than across, breeding lines (88 and 12\\%, respectively). The outcrossing rate was estimated at 16\\%. Understanding chromosome number and origin is necessary for developing a population of breeding lines that can be used as parents. Our results suggest that the perennial wheat breeding lines act as a single diverse population that can be improved using breeding strategies for inbred and outcrossing crops.","tags":["wheat","population genetics"],"title":"Perennial wheat lines have highly admixed population structure and elevated rates of outcrossing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Piaskowski","Weddell, B","Fuerst, E.P.","Roberts, D","Carpenter-Boggs, L"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362096000,"objectID":"54ebdbe9b9f22673355c0e33e0e4d760","permalink":"/publication/networks/","publishdate":"2013-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/networks/","section":"publication","summary":"Extension can play a valuable role by bringing together those who are pioneering innovative practices.
